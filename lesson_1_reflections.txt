How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    helped save a lot of time

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

easy to restore to last working point if changes made caused errors. easy to compare and find changes made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    you can forgetto commit some times after making change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    easier to compare multiple linked files. You are not required to manage each file individually. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will fetch me the details of all the commit instances i can get the ids and and use git diff to two ids to get the differences between the two instances

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I could easily revert back the changes if i encounter a bug so it definitely increases my confidence to make changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For taking backups of my old working codes.
